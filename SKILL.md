```

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest Nexus commands AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /qa, /ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, the user has namespaced Nexus commands. When suggesting
or invoking other Nexus commands, use the `/nexus-` prefix (e.g., `/nexus-qa` instead
of `/qa`, `/nexus-ship` instead of `/ship`). Disk paths are unaffected — always use
`~/.claude/skills/nexus/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` for reading skill files.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/nexus/nexus-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the release-based "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). `/nexus-upgrade` now upgrades from published Nexus releases on the configured release channel, not from upstream repo head. If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running Nexus v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present, always include the standardized runtime summary before moving on to work, even when `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `yes`.

When summarizing setup or upgrade state, always keep `REPO_MODE` and `EXECUTION_MODE` separate:
- `REPO_MODE` is repo ownership only, for example `solo` or `collaborative`
- `EXECUTION_MODE` is runtime routing only, either `governed_ccb` or `local_provider`
- Never describe `solo` or `collaborative` as an execution mode
- If `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, say it is the current default derived from machine state, not a saved preference
- `EXECUTION_PATH` is the current effective route, for example `codex-via-ccb`
- `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` tells you whether the chosen route is runnable right now in this host/session
- when `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`, also surface `GOVERNED_READY`, `MOUNTED_PROVIDERS`, and `MISSING_PROVIDERS`

Whenever you summarize setup, upgrade, or first-run state, present runtime status in this order:
- Repo mode: `REPO_MODE`
- Execution mode: `EXECUTION_MODE` plus whether it is a saved preference or a machine-state default
- Execution path: `EXECUTION_PATH`
- Current session ready: `CURRENT_SESSION_READY`
- If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`: governed ready, mounted providers, missing providers
- Branch: `_BRANCH`
- Proactive: `PROACTIVE`

When `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` is `no`, explicitly tell the user whether the gap is:
- CCB not installed (`CCB_AVAILABLE=no`), or
- CCB installed but required providers are not mounted (`MISSING_PROVIDERS` is non-empty)

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, state the effective execution mode explicitly using `EXECUTION_MODE` and `CCB_AVAILABLE`. Use `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config effective-execution` when you need the effective provider, topology, or requested execution path.
When `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`, do not ask the user to configure `PRIMARY_PROVIDER` or `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`. Those are local-provider host preferences, not governed CCB config keys.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `yes`, use AskUserQuestion to persist the execution preference:

> Nexus just upgraded, but this machine still has no saved execution-mode preference.
> Repo mode only tells you whether the repo is solo or collaborative.
> Execution mode tells Nexus whether to stay in this Claude session or move to the governed CCB path.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose B if you want the standard governed Nexus path, because CCB is already installed. Completeness: 9/10.
> A) Stay in the current Claude session with local_provider (human: ~0m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 8/10
> B) Persist governed_ccb and use mounted CCB providers (human: ~1m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 9/10

If A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode local_provider
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set primary_provider claude
```
Then explain that the current session can continue with `local_provider`, and if `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY` is empty the default local topology is `single_agent`.

If B:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode governed_ccb
```
Then explain that `governed_ccb` requires active CCB providers for this repo, and that the standard way to start them is `tmux` with `ccb codex gemini claude` if they are not already mounted.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `no`, tell the user Nexus is defaulting to `local_provider` because CCB is not detected, state the effective provider/topology, and tell them they can run `./setup` later if they want Nexus to help install CCB before switching to `governed_ccb`.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Nexus Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "Nexus follows the **Completeness Principle** — when the bounded, correct
implementation costs only a little more than the shortcut, prefer finishing the real job."

Then run:

```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.completeness-intro-seen
```

This only happens once.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about proactive behavior. Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus can proactively figure out when you might need a skill while you work —
> like suggesting /qa when you say "does this work?" or /investigate when you hit
> a bug. We recommend keeping this on — it speeds up every part of your workflow.

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`:
Check if a CLAUDE.md file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.
Before prompting, treat either the standard `## Nexus Skill Routing` section or any
existing instruction that routes lifecycle work through `/discover` to `/closeout`
as equivalent Nexus routing guidance. If equivalent guidance already exists, skip this entirely.

Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus works best when your project's CLAUDE.md includes canonical Nexus command
> routing guidance. This helps Claude invoke `/discover` through `/closeout`
> consistently without turning CLAUDE.md into a second contract layer.

Options:
- A) Add Nexus invocation guidance to CLAUDE.md (recommended)
- B) No thanks, I'll invoke Nexus commands manually

If A: Append this section to the end of CLAUDE.md only when the file does not already
contain equivalent Nexus routing guidance:

```markdown

## Nexus Skill Routing

When the user's request matches a canonical Nexus command, invoke that command first.
This guidance helps command discovery only.
Contracts, transitions, governed artifacts, and lifecycle truth are owned by `lib/nexus/`
and canonical `.planning/` artifacts.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke discover
- Scope definition, requirements framing, non-goals → invoke frame
- Architecture review, execution readiness, implementation planning → invoke plan
- Governed routing and handoff packaging → invoke handoff
- Bounded implementation execution → invoke build
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- Final governed verification and closure → invoke closeout
```

Do not auto-commit the file. After updating `CLAUDE.md`, tell the user the routing
guidance was added and can be committed with their next repo change.

If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set routing_declined true`
Say "No problem. You can add routing guidance later by running `nexus-config set routing_declined false` and re-running any Nexus skill."

This only happens once per project. If `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`, skip this entirely.

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, sharp, never corporate, never academic. Sound like a builder, not a consultant. Name the file, the function, the command. No filler, no throat-clearing.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods, "..."). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — the user decides.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your Nexus experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** Nexus tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but Nexus failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.nexus/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

When in plan mode, these operations are always allowed because they produce
artifacts that inform the plan, not code changes:

- `$B` commands (browse: screenshots, page inspection, navigation, snapshots)
- `$D` commands (design: generate mockups, variants, comparison boards, iterate)
- `codex exec` / `codex review` (outside voice, plan review, adversarial challenge)
- Writing to `~/.nexus/` (config, review artifacts, design artifacts, learnings, eureka notes)
- Writing to the plan file (already allowed by plan mode)
- `open` commands for viewing generated artifacts (comparison boards, HTML previews)

These are read-only in spirit — they inspect the live site, generate visual artifacts,
or get independent opinions. They do NOT modify project source files.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

If `PROACTIVE` is `false`: do NOT proactively invoke or suggest other Nexus skills during
this session. Only run skills the user explicitly invokes. This preference persists across
sessions via `nexus-config`.

If `PROACTIVE` is `true` (default): **invoke the Skill tool** when the user's request
matches a skill's purpose. Do NOT answer directly when a skill exists for the task.
Use the Skill tool to invoke it. The skill has specialized workflows, checklists, and
quality gates that produce better results than answering inline.

**Routing rules — when you see these patterns, INVOKE the skill via the Skill tool:**
- User describes a new idea, asks "is this worth building", wants to brainstorm → invoke `/discover`
- User asks about strategy, scope, non-goals, or success criteria → invoke `/frame`
- User asks to review architecture, lock in execution readiness, or turn scope into a plan → invoke `/plan`
- User asks about design system, brand, visual identity → invoke `/design-consultation`
- User asks to review design of a plan → invoke `/plan-design-review`
- User asks for governed routing or handoff packaging → invoke `/handoff`
- User wants a bounded implementation executed → invoke `/build`
- User reports a bug, error, broken behavior, asks "why is this broken" → invoke `/investigate`
- User asks to test the site, find bugs, QA → invoke `/qa`
- User asks to review code, audit an implementation result, or check governed review output → invoke `/review`
- User asks about visual polish, design audit of a live site → invoke `/design-review`
- User asks to ship, gate release readiness, or decide merge readiness → invoke `/ship`
- User asks to formally conclude reviewed work or verify final governed state → invoke `/closeout`
- User asks to update docs after shipping → invoke `/document-release`
- User asks for a weekly retro, what did we ship → invoke `/retro`
- User asks for a second opinion, codex review → invoke `/codex`
- User asks for safety mode, careful mode → invoke `/careful` or `/guard`
- User asks to restrict edits to a directory → invoke `/freeze` or `/unfreeze`
- User asks to upgrade Nexus → invoke `/nexus-upgrade`

**Do NOT answer the user's question directly when a matching skill exists.** The skill
provides a structured, multi-step workflow that is always better than an ad-hoc answer.
Invoke the skill first. If no skill matches, answer directly as usual.

If the user opts out of suggestions, run `nexus-config set proactive false`.
If they opt back in, run `nexus-config set proactive true`.

# nexus browse: QA Testing & Dogfooding

Persistent headless Chromium. First call auto-starts (~3s), then ~100-200ms per command.
Auto-shuts down after 30 min idle. State persists between calls (cookies, tabs, sessions).

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/nexus/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/nexus/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B=~/.claude/skills/nexus/browse/dist/browse
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "nexus browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. Run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed:
   ```bash
   if ! command -v bun >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     BUN_VERSION="1.3.10"
     BUN_INSTALL_SHA="bab8acfb046aac8c72407bdcce903957665d655d7acaa3e11c7c4616beae68dd"
     tmpfile=$(mktemp)
     curl -fsSL "https://bun.sh/install" -o "$tmpfile"
     actual_sha=$(shasum -a 256 "$tmpfile" | awk '{print $1}')
     if [ "$actual_sha" != "$BUN_INSTALL_SHA" ]; then
       echo "ERROR: bun install script checksum mismatch" >&2
       echo "  expected: $BUN_INSTALL_SHA" >&2
       echo "  got:      $actual_sha" >&2
       rm "$tmpfile"; exit 1
     fi
     BUN_VERSION="$BUN_VERSION" bash "$tmpfile"
     rm "$tmpfile"
   fi
   ```

## IMPORTANT

- Use the compiled binary via Bash: `$B <command>`
- NEVER use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools. They are slow and unreliable.
- Browser persists between calls — cookies, login sessions, and tabs carry over.
- Dialogs (alert/confirm/prompt) are auto-accepted by default — no browser lockup.
- **Show screenshots:** After `$B screenshot`, `$B snapshot -a -o`, or `$B responsive`, always use the Read tool on the output PNG(s) so the user can see them. Without this, screenshots are invisible.

## QA Workflows

> **Credential safety:** Use environment variables for test credentials.
> Set them before running: `export TEST_EMAIL="..." TEST_PASSWORD="..."`

### Test a user flow (login, signup, checkout, etc.)

```bash
# 1. Go to the page
$B goto https://app.example.com/login

# 2. See what's interactive
$B snapshot -i

# 3. Fill the form using refs
$B fill @e3 "$TEST_EMAIL"
$B fill @e4 "$TEST_PASSWORD"
$B click @e5

# 4. Verify it worked
$B snapshot -D              # diff shows what changed after clicking
$B is visible ".dashboard"  # assert the dashboard appeared
$B screenshot /tmp/after-login.png
```

### Verify a deployment / check prod

```bash
$B goto https://yourapp.com
$B text                          # read the page — does it load?
$B console                       # any JS errors?
$B network                       # any failed requests?
$B js "document.title"           # correct title?
$B is visible ".hero-section"    # key elements present?
$B screenshot /tmp/prod-check.png
```

### Dogfood a feature end-to-end

```bash
# Navigate to the feature
$B goto https://app.example.com/new-feature

# Take annotated screenshot — shows every interactive element with labels
$B snapshot -i -a -o /tmp/feature-annotated.png

# Find ALL clickable things (including divs with cursor:pointer)
$B snapshot -C

# Walk through the flow
$B snapshot -i          # baseline
$B click @e3            # interact
$B snapshot -D          # what changed? (unified diff)

# Check element states
$B is visible ".success-toast"
$B is enabled "#next-step-btn"
$B is checked "#agree-checkbox"

# Check console for errors after interactions
$B console
```

### Test responsive layouts

```bash
# Quick: 3 screenshots at mobile/tablet/desktop
$B goto https://yourapp.com
$B responsive /tmp/layout

# Manual: specific viewport
$B viewport 375x812     # iPhone
$B screenshot /tmp/mobile.png
$B viewport 1440x900    # Desktop
$B screenshot /tmp/desktop.png

# Element screenshot (crop to specific element)
$B screenshot "#hero-banner" /tmp/hero.png
$B snapshot -i
$B screenshot @e3 /tmp/button.png

# Region crop
$B screenshot --clip 0,0,800,600 /tmp/above-fold.png

# Viewport only (no scroll)
$B screenshot --viewport /tmp/viewport.png
```

### Test file upload

```bash
$B goto https://app.example.com/upload
$B snapshot -i
$B upload @e3 /path/to/test-file.pdf
$B is visible ".upload-success"
$B screenshot /tmp/upload-result.png
```

### Test forms with validation

```bash
$B goto https://app.example.com/form
$B snapshot -i

# Submit empty — check validation errors appear
$B click @e10                        # submit button
$B snapshot -D                       # diff shows error messages appeared
$B is visible ".error-message"

# Fill and resubmit
$B fill @e3 "valid input"
$B click @e10
$B snapshot -D                       # diff shows errors gone, success state
```

### Test dialogs (delete confirmations, prompts)

```bash
# Set up dialog handling BEFORE triggering
$B dialog-accept              # will auto-accept next alert/confirm
$B click "#delete-button"     # triggers confirmation dialog
$B dialog                     # see what dialog appeared
$B snapshot -D                # verify the item was deleted

# For prompts that need input
$B dialog-accept "my answer"  # accept with text
$B click "#rename-button"     # triggers prompt
```

### Test authenticated pages (import real browser cookies)

```bash
# Import cookies from your real browser (opens interactive picker)
$B cookie-import-browser

# Or import a specific domain directly
$B cookie-import-browser comet --domain .github.com

# Now test authenticated pages
$B goto https://github.com/settings/profile
$B snapshot -i
$B screenshot /tmp/github-profile.png
```

> **Cookie safety:** `cookie-import-browser` transfers real session data.
> Only import cookies from browsers you control.

### Compare two pages / environments

```bash
$B diff https://staging.app.com https://prod.app.com
```

### Multi-step chain (efficient for long flows)

```bash
echo '[
  ["goto","https://app.example.com"],
  ["snapshot","-i"],
  ["fill","@e3","$TEST_EMAIL"],
  ["fill","@e4","$TEST_PASSWORD"],
  ["click","@e5"],
  ["snapshot","-D"],
  ["screenshot","/tmp/result.png"]
]' | $B chain
```

## Quick Assertion Patterns

```bash
# Element exists and is visible
$B is visible ".modal"

# Button is enabled/disabled
$B is enabled "#submit-btn"
$B is disabled "#submit-btn"

# Checkbox state
$B is checked "#agree"

# Input is editable
$B is editable "#name-field"

# Element has focus
$B is focused "#search-input"

# Page contains text
$B js "document.body.textContent.includes('Success')"

# Element count
$B js "document.querySelectorAll('.list-item').length"

# Specific attribute value
$B attrs "#logo"    # returns all attributes as JSON

# CSS property
$B css ".button" "background-color"
```

## Snapshot System

The snapshot is your primary tool for understanding and interacting with pages.

```
-i        --interactive           Interactive elements only (buttons, links, inputs) with @e refs
-c        --compact               Compact (no empty structural nodes)
-d <N>    --depth                 Limit tree depth (0 = root only, default: unlimited)
-s <sel>  --selector              Scope to CSS selector
-D        --diff                  Unified diff against previous snapshot (first call stores baseline)
-a        --annotate              Annotated screenshot with red overlay boxes and ref labels
-o <path> --output                Output path for annotated screenshot (default: <temp>/browse-annotated.png)
-C        --cursor-interactive    Cursor-interactive elements (@c refs — divs with pointer, onclick)
```

All flags can be combined freely. `-o` only applies when `-a` is also used.
Example: `$B snapshot -i -a -C -o /tmp/annotated.png`

**Ref numbering:** @e refs are assigned sequentially (@e1, @e2, ...) in tree order.
@c refs from `-C` are numbered separately (@c1, @c2, ...).

After snapshot, use @refs as selectors in any command:
```bash
$B click @e3       $B fill @e4 "value"     $B hover @e1
$B html @e2        $B css @e5 "color"      $B attrs @e6
$B click @c1       # cursor-interactive ref (from -C)
```

**Output format:** indented accessibility tree with @ref IDs, one element per line.
```
  @e1 [heading] "Welcome" [level=1]
  @e2 [textbox] "Email"
  @e3 [button] "Submit"
```

Refs are invalidated on navigation — run `snapshot` again after `goto`.

## Tips

1. **Navigate once, query many times.** `goto` loads the page; then `text`, `js`, `screenshot` all hit the loaded page instantly.
2. **Use `snapshot -i` first.** See all interactive elements, then click/fill by ref. No CSS selector guessing.
3. **Use `snapshot -D` to verify.** Baseline → action → diff. See exactly what changed.
4. **Use `is` for assertions.** `is visible .modal` is faster and more reliable than parsing page text.
5. **Use `snapshot -a` for evidence.** Annotated screenshots are great for bug reports.
6. **Use `snapshot -C` for tricky UIs.** Finds clickable divs that the accessibility tree misses.
7. **Check `console` after actions.** Catch JS errors that don't surface visually.
8. **Use `chain` for long flows.** Single command, no per-step CLI overhead.
