If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest Nexus commands AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /qa, /ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, the user has namespaced Nexus commands. When suggesting
or invoking other Nexus commands, use the `/nexus-` prefix (e.g., `/nexus-qa` instead
of `/qa`, `/nexus-ship` instead of `/ship`). Disk paths are unaffected — always use
`~/.claude/skills/nexus/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` for reading skill files.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/nexus/nexus-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the release-based "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). `/nexus-upgrade` now upgrades from published Nexus releases on the configured release channel, not from upstream repo head. If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running Nexus v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

When summarizing setup or upgrade state, always keep `REPO_MODE` and `EXECUTION_MODE` separate:
- `REPO_MODE` is repo ownership only, for example `solo` or `collaborative`
- `EXECUTION_MODE` is runtime routing only, either `governed_ccb` or `local_provider`
- Never describe `solo` or `collaborative` as an execution mode
- If `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, say it is the current default derived from machine state, not a saved preference

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, state the effective execution mode explicitly using `EXECUTION_MODE`, `PRIMARY_PROVIDER`, `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`, and `CCB_AVAILABLE`.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `yes`, use AskUserQuestion to persist the execution preference:

> Nexus just upgraded, but this machine still has no saved execution-mode preference.
> Repo mode only tells you whether the repo is solo or collaborative.
> Execution mode tells Nexus whether to stay in this Claude session or move to the governed CCB path.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose B if you want the standard governed Nexus path, because CCB is already installed. Completeness: 9/10.
> A) Stay in the current Claude session with local_provider (human: ~0m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 8/10
> B) Persist governed_ccb and relaunch Claude inside tmux (human: ~1m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 9/10

If A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode local_provider
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set primary_provider claude
```
Then explain that the current session can continue with `local_provider`, and if `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY` is empty the default local topology is `single_agent`.

If B:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode governed_ccb
```
Then explain that `governed_ccb` requires leaving the current Claude session and relaunching inside tmux with `ccb codex gemini claude`.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `no`, tell the user Nexus is defaulting to `local_provider` because CCB is not detected, state the effective provider/topology, and tell them they can run `./setup` later if they want Nexus to help install CCB before switching to `governed_ccb`.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Nexus Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "Nexus follows the **Completeness Principle** — when the bounded, correct
implementation costs only a little more than the shortcut, prefer finishing the real job."

Then run:

```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.completeness-intro-seen
```

This only happens once.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about proactive behavior. Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus can proactively figure out when you might need a skill while you work —
> like suggesting /qa when you say "does this work?" or /investigate when you hit
> a bug. We recommend keeping this on — it speeds up every part of your workflow.

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`:
Check if a CLAUDE.md file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.

Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus works best when your project's CLAUDE.md includes canonical Nexus command
> routing guidance. This helps Claude invoke `/discover` through `/closeout`
> consistently without turning CLAUDE.md into a second contract layer.

Options:
- A) Add Nexus invocation guidance to CLAUDE.md (recommended)
- B) No thanks, I'll invoke Nexus commands manually

If A: Append this section to the end of CLAUDE.md:

```markdown

## Nexus Skill Routing

When the user's request matches a canonical Nexus command, invoke that command first.
This guidance helps command discovery only.
Contracts, transitions, governed artifacts, and lifecycle truth are owned by `lib/nexus/`
and canonical `.planning/` artifacts.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke discover
- Scope definition, requirements framing, non-goals → invoke frame
- Architecture review, execution readiness, implementation planning → invoke plan
- Governed routing and handoff packaging → invoke handoff
- Bounded implementation execution → invoke build
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- Final governed verification and closure → invoke closeout
```

Then commit the change: `git add CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "chore: add nexus skill routing guidance to CLAUDE.md"`

If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set routing_declined true`
Say "No problem. You can add routing guidance later by running `nexus-config set routing_declined false` and re-running any Nexus skill."

This only happens once per project. If `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`, skip this entirely.

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, sharp, never corporate, never academic. Sound like a builder, not a consultant. Name the file, the function, the command. No filler, no throat-clearing.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods, "..."). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — the user decides.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your Nexus experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** Nexus tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but Nexus failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.nexus/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

When in plan mode, these operations are always allowed because they produce
artifacts that inform the plan, not code changes:

- `$B` commands (browse: screenshots, page inspection, navigation, snapshots)
- `$D` commands (design: generate mockups, variants, comparison boards, iterate)
- `codex exec` / `codex review` (outside voice, plan review, adversarial challenge)
- Writing to `~/.nexus/` (config, review artifacts, design artifacts, learnings, eureka notes)
- Writing to the plan file (already allowed by plan mode)
- `open` commands for viewing generated artifacts (comparison boards, HTML previews)

These are read-only in spirit — they inspect the live site, generate visual artifacts,
or get independent opinions. They do NOT modify project source files.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# /plan-eng-review — Transitional Alias

This alias routes to `/frame`.
This alias does not own separate contract, artifact, or transition logic.
Use `/frame` as the canonical lifecycle entrypoint.

Run:

```bash
bun run bin/nexus.ts plan-eng-review
```

Then read:

- `.planning/nexus/current-run.json`
- `.planning/current/frame/status.json`
